# Package Video

This repo contains a script that helps package videos. Package in this
context means to add title and credit slides, overlay a logo,
etc. The goal is to take simple video content and automatically polish
it up.

# Setup

This script relies on ffmpeg. You'll want to grab ffmpeg from:

https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases

Download the file named ffmpeg-XXXXXXX-win64-gpl.zip. For example:

https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/autobuild-2021-01-10-12-44/ffmpeg-N-100604-g2e2891383e-win64-gpl.zip

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the file, move the bin directory
into the same directory as this README.
